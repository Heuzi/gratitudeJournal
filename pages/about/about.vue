		<text>Previous research has shown that the practice of gratitude both in gratitude group and through gratitude journaling has positive mental, physical, and social benefits. 
		
		This is a journal app to record gratitude journal and self-assessments.
		
		This app is originally built for the purpose of Gratitude Research conducted by Kuo Deng, advised by Dr. Joel Wong. 
		The app does not track any information outside itself. It only tracks the journals you entered, and the User ID. 
		
		The data are kept locally on the phone, and also transferred, via a secure API, to the Indiana University REDCap service. 
		Only approved research staff are granted access to the data.

		Developed using Uniapp, by Xiaomeng Ye. Contact me via xiaye@iu.edu.
